        <h2>USURPING UPPER BODY</h2>
        <p>Level up your upper body with our USURPING UPPER BODY workout! Our focus is a one-two punch of power and strength: overhead press and barbell rows for upper body dominance, and pull ups and dips for a torso Tarzan would dream of! But we don't stop there, we also pump up the chest with machine flys and balance the shoulders with machine reverse flys for a complete upper body takeover.</p>
